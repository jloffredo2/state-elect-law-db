In the event of noncompliance for either the audit or review, the secretary of state can withhold funds. The state or any other political body under the state may not receive private money for the election, except for limited forms of in-kind donations. Exception: in any even-numbered year where the state funds for counties are less than the previously distributed amounts, private money can be received and used to make the difference. Board of election employees and election judges do not have to be registered in the jurisdiction. Anyone who solicits 10 or more voter registration forms is required to register. 
The division of motor vehicles and drivers licensing will be required to send voter registration forms to the election authority within 3 days of the individual completing the application. Starting in 2023, voter applications will include an option to affiliate with a political party. Voters registered prior to 2023, may choose a party affiliation at the polling location. Registered voters may change their address or affiliation at the office of the election authority on or before election day, with a photo identification. Absentee ballots can be cast in person at designated locations if the individual meets 1 of the absentee reasons in statute. Absentee ballots can be cast in-person absentee with photo identification, or completed elsewhere and notarized, with some exceptions. Starting the second Tuesday before the election, any qualified voter can use an absentee ballot. Absentee ballots received in person or at an authorized location (no drop boxes) must come in prior to the election, if sent through USPS they must be received prior to the closing of polls. Mail-in ballots (different than absentee ballots) are not to be used.
Touchscreen, direct-recording machines when ready for replacement will be replaced with paper ballot marking devices. Starting in 2024, no machines of that kind can be used.

Election authorities are to be added as members to Center for Internet Security and will allow cyber security reviews of offices. If in violation, the secretary of state can withhold non-federal funds. The bill establishes a Federal Election Fund in the state treasury which will house all appropriated, federal money designated for elections. Federal laws regarding elections would be subject to review by the joint committee on administrative rules prior to be implemented in the state.
Starting in 2023, the official ballot will be paper ballots “hand marked by the voter,” except for ballots cast by voters needing assistance due to disability. Antifraud countermeasures, including paper type, watermarks, bank security, and numbering, will be required for all printed ballots. Applications for absentee ballot would now require the voter identification number be provided. In person absentee voting at authorized locations and voters at a polling location will require a photo identification to vote. Mail-in ballots (different than absentee ballots) are only to be used when authorized by executive or administrative order.

They would have to designate the party selection on their voter registration by the 23rd Tuesday before a primary election (including presidential preference primary). If a voter wants to change their affiliation after the 23rd Tuesday before a primary election, the change will apply after the election takes place. Notice of change must be done via a signed, written notice following the same process as a voter’s change of address notice. If an individual is unregistered to vote but registers before 5:00 PM on the 4th Wednesday before the primary election, they may choose a party affiliation and vote in the primary election. Those voting via absentee will only receive a primary ballot with the affiliated political party or the unaffiliated ballot. 19 weeks or sooner before a primary election date the secretary of state will distribute a list of registered voters eligible to vote in each political party’s primary election. 
This “closed primary” system will take effect starting in 2025. Political parties established under section 115.315 are allowed to be exempt from this system and hold a caucus or other election. New voter registration application with political party affiliation question will be available starting in 2023. During the 2024 primary and presidential preference primary, voters who registered prior to 2023 will be registered going forward for whichever political party primary they choose to vote in that election. Voters who registered prior to 2023 who also did not vote in the primary elections will have the opportunity to choose a party affiliation at the general election.

Specifically, this bill suspends automatic voter registration until each county commissioner of registration, county board of elections, and county clerk, in consultation with the Secretary of State, have developed and implemented the necessary uniform standards and procedures to maintain voter registration rolls. Under the bill, the standards would include, but may not be limited to: (1) procedures to prevent the creation of duplicate voting records for the same person; (2) the timely removal of the voter registration records of inactive, deceased, and non-resident voters; and (3) the routine cross check of voter registration information with other databases maintained by this State and, if feasible, databases of other states, to identify potential voter records that might be eligible for removal. The bill requires the secretary and county election officials, within six months following the effective date, to report to the Governor and the Legislature the accuracy standards and procedures and the timeline for their implementation, including recommendations for any statutory changes that may be required. Under the bill, automatic voter registration would be reactivated upon enactment of the legislation or at a date specified by the Secretary of State. Voter registration at the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission and at any other agency would be conducted using paper voter registrations in the manner specified under current law, until automatic voter registration is reactivated.

2721,NJ,S1712,"Governor, State Legislature-estab. ranked-choice voting procedure for elections","Introduced in the Senate, Referred to Senate State Government, Wagering, Tourism & Historic Preservation Committee",2022-02-28,Introduced,Ranked-choice voting,https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1454782/30830,2022,"<p>This bill establishes a ranked-choice voting procedure for primary and general elections to elect candidates to the offices of Governor, New Jersey Senate, New Jersey General Assembly, United States Senate, and United States House of Representatives, and for presidential primary elections and general elections for electors of candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States. Ranked-choice voting is an election method in which voters rank candidates in order of their preference, the ballots are counted in rounds, and the votes or fractions of votes are distributed to candidates according to the preferences marked on each ballot. The bill requires the ballot to be designed to allow voters to assign a ranking order to each qualified candidate on the ballot for such offices, including write-in candidates. In the event that the voting equipment cannot feasibly accommodate a ballot containing a number of rankings equal to the number of qualified candidates, the ballot is permitted to be designed to allow a voter to rank the maximum number allowed by the voting equipment, but not less than six candidates. Under the bill, single-winner elections to the offices of Governor, New Jersey Senate, United States Senate, and United States House of Representatives, and presidential primaries and general elections for electors of candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States, would be tabulated in rounds. Each ballot counts as one vote for the highest-ranked candidate on that ballot. If a candidate reaches the election threshold of 50 percent of the votes plus one, that candidate is elected and the tabulation is complete. If two or fewer continuing candidates remain, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, the candidate with the greatest number of votes is elected, and the tabulation is complete. However, if more than two continuing candidates remain, the continuing candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, and a new round of counting begins until a candidate reaches the election threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>For multi-winner elections to the office of member of the New Jersey General Assembly, which include two members elected from each election district, the bill establishes a tabulation procedure that involves the transfer of vote fractions. Under the bill, if, in the initial tabulation, the number of continuing candidates is less than or equal to two (which is the number of offices to be filled for the New Jersey General Assembly in the legislative district), then all continuing candidates are elected and the tabulation is complete. If not, a series of tabulation rounds would proceed sequentially until candidates are elected by reaching the election threshold of 33 percent of the votes plus one. If the sum of the number of elected candidates and the number of continuing candidates is equal to three (the sum of one and the number of offices to be elected), then the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, all other continuing candidates are elected, and the tabulation is complete. However, if at least one continuing candidate has more votes than the election threshold, then each such candidate is elected, and each ballot counting for an elected candidate is assigned a ""transfer value"" so that the candidate's surplus votes (beyond the election threshold) are distributed to the next ranked continuing candidate on those ballots. If, after these steps, no candidate is elected, then the continuing candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, and a new round of counting begins until the positions are filled as the remaining candidates reach the election threshold. The bill directs the Secretary of State to issue guidelines and promulgate any rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the ranked-choice voting procedures established by the bill. The bill would take effect immediately, but would remain inoperative until the January 1st following 12 months after the Secretary of State officially certifies that all voting machines used in this State have the capability to support ranked-choice voting. However, the bill's provisions concerning elections to the office of Governor would be implemented if the voters approve an amendment to the State Constitution authorizing ranked-choice for that office.

A voter, whether voting in person or through mail-in ballot, would be required to show or submit a copy of a New Jersey's driver's license, New Jersey nondriver's identification card, or other document, that includes all of the following criteria: (1) the name of the voter to whom the document was issued; (2) a photograph of the voter to whom the document was issued; (3) an expiration date, showing that the document is not expired or expired only after the date of the most recent election; and (4) was issued by the federal government or this State. For first-time voters, this documentation would be required in addition to the production of any document necessary to fulfill the proof of identity requirement mandated by the federal ""Help America Vote Act of 2002,"" if that first-time voter had registered to vote by mail without submitting federally-acceptable identity verification with the registration. However, a first-time voter in this situation would be required to present only one document with respect to both identification requirements, if that document is able to satisfy the document criteria as applicable to each requirement. The requirement for verifying voter identity through additional documentation would not apply to any voter entitled to vote by mail-in ballot under the federal ""Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,"" or provided the right to vote otherwise than in person under the federal ""Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act,"" or any other federal law. Additionally, because the bill's verification of identity requires the production of a document containing a photograph of the voter, it incorporates an exemption from the production of such document if the voter has a religious objection to being photographed, and this is established by a sworn affidavit from the voter. In order to administer the bill's new voter verification requirement, the bill updates the statutory provisions governing election day challenges to a person's right to vote by district board members or other authorized challengers. With respect to any voter who is denied the right to vote for failing to display acceptable documentation, that voter would be provided a provisional ballot. In order for that ballot to be officially counted in an election, the voter would need to produce the required documentation by the close of business on the second day after the election to the applicable county commissioner of registration. Finally, this bill requires the Motor Vehicle Commission issue a nondriver identification card without cost to any voter requiring such document upon execution of an affidavit of indigence.</p>",3,Democratic,Republican

1305,NJ,A1286,Property taxation-authorizes State constitutional convention to reform,"Introduced, Referred to Assembly State and Local Government Committee",2022-01-11,Introduced,Ballot measures (initiative and referendum),https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1420555,2022,"<p>This bill provides for convening a State constitutional convention for the sole purpose of reforming the system of property taxation. The bill places the question of whether a convention should be convened before the voters at a general election. The approval by the voters at that general election would confer upon the convention the authority to recommend relevant changes to the State Constitution and changes to the New Jersey statutes. The convention's recommendations for changes to the State Constitution and changes to the New Jersey statutes would be presented to the voters as a single package for their approval at the next general election; except that, if a temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes for voter approval is not placed on the ballot at a general election, the convention may anticipate that such a constitutional amendment may be placed on the next general election ballot at the same time as the convention's proposal and the convention, at its discretion, may structure its proposal so that, if the constitutional amendment fails to receive voter approval, the convention's entire proposal will also fail, or any constitutional amendments proposed by the convention and approved by the voters, but not statutory changes, will be adopted. Thus, statutory changes proposed by the convention will become effective if a separate temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes for voter approval is adopted not later than the general election at which the voters approve the convention's proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill also provides that at an annual school election, two delegates to the convention will be elected from each of the 40 legislative districts, for a total of 80 elected delegates. The names of candidates for the office of delegate on the ballot will rotate in successive election districts in order to limit any potential impact of ballot position on voter choice. A nominee for election of the office of delegate would not be bracketed with any other candidate on the ballot and no designation, slogan or affiliation for a nominee would be printed on the ballot. The bill limits the amount of a contribution to a candidate for the office of delegate from any contributor to $250 with a limit of $6,250 in the aggregate on contributions to all candidates for the office of delegate. Delegates would be nominated by a petition signed by at least 100 registered voters of the district from which the delegate seeks election. Local elected officials would be eligible to serve as delegates, but members of the Legislature would be ineligible to be elected, or to serve, as delegates. Labor organizations and corporations would be prohibited from contributing to the campaigns of candidates for the office of delegate. The bill establishes a voluntary limit of $25,000 on expenditures made in connection with a candidacy for the office of delegate. Any candidate, or any committee, group or organization in support of that candidate, that pledges to expend, and expends, less than that amount in connection with that candidate's candidacy may include on its campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate, committee, group, or organization has complied with the voluntary campaign expenditure limit. Any candidate for the office of delegate, or any committee, group or organization in support of that candidate, that expends more than $25,000 in connection with that candidate's candidacy would be required to include on all subsequent campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate, committee, group, or organization has exceeded the voluntary campaign expenditure limit.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the 80 elected delegates to the convention, 10 additional delegates will be appointed, two each by the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly, and the Minority Leader of the General Assembly. These appointments will be made within ten days of the certification of the results of the election for delegates. In making the appointments, the appointing authorities will take into consideration this State's demographic diversity and the degree to which that diversity is represented by the delegates elected to the convention. The duty of the convention will be to prepare a proposal consisting of amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and, if the voters approve a temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes, changes to existing law, which, while revenue neutral in their overall impact, eliminate inequities in the current system of property taxation, ensure greater uniformity in the application of property taxes, reduce property taxes as a share of overall public revenue, provide alternatives which lessen the dependence of local government on property taxes, or provide alternative means, including possible increases in other taxes, of funding local government services. The bill expressly provides that the convention may not propose amendments affecting the obligation of the Legislature, under the New Jersey Constitution, to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools or the obligation of any municipality to provide affordable housing pursuant to decisions of the New Jersey Supreme Court. In addition, the convention will not consider or recommend any proposal providing for a Statewide equalized school property tax, or detracting from collective bargaining rights or dispute resolution procedures as those rights and procedures exist on the effective date of this act, or that fails to provide tenants of residential rental units with their proportionate share of any property tax reduction, in a non-discriminatory manner, for as long as the reduction lasts.</p><p>&nbsp;Any changes of the New Jersey statutes recommended by the convention and approved by the voters at a general election held and will thereafter be subject to amendment or repeal by the Legislature and the Governor in the same manner as other laws. The convention is limited to considering the issue of tax reform. It may not consider any other issues. The bill directs the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court to appoint a committee of three retired members of the Judiciary, no more than two of whom shall be of the same political party, that will review proposals prepared by the convention during the course of the convention's proceedings and advise the convention whether such proposals are in compliance with the convention's instructions as voted by the people and do not exceed those instructions or the convention's limited purpose in any way. The convention will not take a vote on its final proposal to be placed on the ballot for voter approval unless the committee has certified that the convention has complied with its instructions and not exceeded those instructions or its limited purpose. The bill directs the Legislative Services Commission to undertake certain research tasks in advance of the convention, as well as during the convention, and to recruit qualified employees who may be employed by the convention. The bill appropriates $3,845,000 to effectuate its purposes.<br></p>",3,Democratic,Democratic

Under the bill, the program, at a minimum, must provide for the crosschecking of information in the Statewide database with information obtained via voter registration information agreements entered into by the secretary under current law and must provide for the sharing of voter information among each county clerk and commissioner of registration. The secretary, in consultation with each commissioner of registration, is required to establish uniform standards and procedures for voter list maintenance and crosschecking. At a minimum, the program must permit a county commissioner of registration to verify a new voter registration applicant's information, update information in the Statewide voter registration system, and remove duplicate, non-resident, or ineligible voters from the Statewide voter registration system. The bill also requires the annual report on the voter registration system to the Governor and the Legislature to be submitted no later than 90 days following the date of the November general election. Under the bill and in addition to the requirements in current law, the report is required to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of any voter registration information agreements entered into by the Secretary of State; (2) list the number of inactive and active voters in the State by county, the number of registrants transferred to the death file by county, and the number of registrants removed from the Statewide voter registration system by county; and (3) list the counties that are not compliant with the standards and procedures for voter list maintenance and crosschecking established by the Secretary of State.</p>",7,Democratic,Republican

The bill also prohibits the Governor from restricting the ability of voters to vote in person without the approval of the majority vote of the Legislature.

Under the pilot program, the commissioner of registration, county clerk, and county board of elections in each county would collectively designate one or more locations in each county to allow for same-day voter registration for all eligible residents of that county who wish to register to vote. A voter who registers to vote under the same-day voter registration pilot program would be required to meet the voter eligibility criteria under current law and to complete a voter registration form. Upon registering to vote, such a voter would be directed to the voter's designated polling place and be permitted to cast a provisional ballot. The bill requires the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the commissioner of registration, county clerk, and county board of elections in each county, to submit three interim reports and one final report to the Governor and the Legislature on the effectiveness of the pilot program, including an audit of the program. The interim reports would be due by January 31 of 2022, 2023, and 2024, and the final report would be due by March 1, 2024. The bill further provides that, if the final report finds that the pilot program was successful in increasing voter registration and participation in the elections relative to comparable general elections, with a low risk for voter fraud, then it would include recommendations for the enactment of same-day voter registration in this State at every polling location for the 2024 general election, and all elections thereafter. Such implementation would require enabling legislation. This bill would take effect immediately, and would expire on March 1, 2024, or upon the issuance of the final report, whichever occurs later.</p>",3,Democratic,Democratic

The bill specifies that within five years all counties must (1) use paper ballots and optical scanners that read hand-marked paper ballots and (2) use voting equipment certified for use by the Secretary of State that has open-source software technology. As used in the bill, the term ""open-source"" means the complete source code for the software is available to the public, under the terms of a license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or other considerations. Under the bill, the paper ballot voting system must: (1) provide the local elections officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place; (2) provide a record of votes cast for the election; (3) adhere to any federal laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and (4) adhere to any other requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of a paper ballot voting system in this State. The bill directs the Secretary of State to require that each county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an election for a period of not less than two years following the date of an election. Thereafter, the ballots may be retained in accordance with procedures set forth by the Secretary of State. The bill also requires that prior to verification of the official election results by a county clerk or superintendent of elections or a municipal clerk, as the case may be, the county clerk or superintendent of elections or municipal clerk must: (1) compare and reconcile the record of votes casts provided by the optical scanners or other voting equipment certified by the State with the number of voters who signed in at the polling place and who voted by mail-in, provisional, and military or overseas ballots; (2) compare and reconcile precinct totals with the totals for that election to ensure that the totals add up to the correct sum; and (3) review, and account for, all optical scanner or other voting equipment memory cards or flash drives to ensure the memory cards or flash drives are properly loaded into the tally server. Under the bill, after a voter is deemed qualified to vote in an election, the voter would receive a paper ballot, which would be completed by the voter in a voting booth. Once completed, the ballot would be scanned electronically for technical errors, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted. If such an error exists, it would be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot would be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voter's vote from being counted. If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found, the ballot would be considered valid and would be counted. The bill also makes an appropriation and provides that the cost of replacing exiting direct recording electronic voting machines with paper ballots and the voting equipment necessary to tabulate those ballots would be paid for by the State upon application for reimbursement by a county governing body to the Secretary of State and approval of the application by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The bill also repeals various statutes concerning certain requirements and the certification of electronic voting machines and the purchasing and delivery of those voting machines. Under this bill, a limited number of voting machines would be available for use by individuals with disabilities.</p>",1,Democratic,Republican

The Secretary of State, in real time during the conduct of an election, must compile any incidents or complaints submitted to the Department of State or to county election officials.

The bill requires a voter, whether voting in person or through mail-in ballot, to show or submit a copy of a New Jersey's driver's license, New Jersey nondriver's identification card, or other document, that includes all of the following criteria: (1) the name of the voter to whom the document was issued; (2) a photograph of the voter to whom the document was issued; (3) an expiration date, showing that the document is not expired or expired only after the date of the most recent election; and (4) was issued by the federal government or this State. For first-time voters, this documentation is required in addition to the production of any document necessary to fulfill the proof of identity requirement mandated by the federal ""Help America Vote Act of 2002,"" if that first-time voter had registered to vote by mail without submitting federally-acceptable identity verification with the registration. However, a first-time voter in this situation is required to present only one document with respect to both identification requirements, if that document is able to satisfy the document criteria as applicable to each requirement. The requirement for verifying voter identity through additional documentation does not apply to any voter entitled to vote by mail-in ballot under the federal ""Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,"" or provided the right to vote otherwise than in person under the federal ""Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act,"" or any other federal law. Additionally, because the bill's verification of identity requires the production of a document containing a photograph of the voter, it incorporates an exemption from the production of such document if the voter has a religious objection to being photographed, and this is established by a sworn affidavit from the voter. In order to administer the bill's new voter verification requirement, the bill updates the statutory provisions governing election day challenges to a person's right to vote by district board members or other authorized challengers. With respect to any voter who is denied the right to vote for failing to display acceptable documentation, that voter is to be provided a provisional ballot. In order for that ballot to be officially counted in an election, the voter would need to produce the required documentation by the close of business on the second day after the election to the applicable county commissioner of registration.
