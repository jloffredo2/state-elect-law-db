This bill states that for statewide ballot measures the Secretary of State will provide county election officials a label prepared by the Attorney General, followed by a list of supporters and opponents, one week after receiving the lists of supporters and opponents. This bill states that each measure will be designated on the ballot with the ballot label certified by the Secretary of State. This bill lays out specific guidelines for the text of the ballot labels, including titles, organization and individual names, how supporters and opponents should be listed. This bill specified how the supporters and opponents lists should be provided to election officials. This list allows election officials to establish deadlines, verify if requirements are met, and set deadlines for corrections. This bill states that at least 30 days before the deadline for submitting arguments for and against county measures, a county board of supervisors may elect not to include supporters and opponents for city, county, district, or school measures on the county ballot and future county ballots. This bill states that a county must include supporters and opponents for all ballot measures or no ballot measures. This bill states that a school or district measure must be treated the same way across counties.

Ranked-choice voting is an election method in which voters rank candidates in order of their preference, the ballots are counted in rounds, and the votes or fractions of votes are distributed to candidates according to the preferences marked on each ballot. The bill requires the ballot to be designed to allow voters to assign a ranking order to each qualified candidate on the ballot for such offices, including write-in candidates. In the event that the voting equipment cannot feasibly accommodate a ballot containing a number of rankings equal to the number of qualified candidates, the ballot is permitted to be designed to allow a voter to rank the maximum number allowed by the voting equipment, but not less than six candidates. Under the bill, single-winner elections to the offices of Governor, New Jersey Senate, United States Senate, and United States House of Representatives, and presidential primaries and general elections for electors of candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States, would be tabulated in rounds. Each ballot counts as one vote for the highest-ranked candidate on that ballot. If a candidate reaches the election threshold of 50 percent of the votes plus one, that candidate is elected and the tabulation is complete. If two or fewer continuing candidates remain, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, the candidate with the greatest number of votes is elected, and the tabulation is complete. However, if more than two continuing candidates remain, the continuing candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, and a new round of counting begins until a candidate reaches the election threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>For multi-winner elections to the office of member of the New Jersey General Assembly, which include two members elected from each election district, the bill establishes a tabulation procedure that involves the transfer of vote fractions. Under the bill, if, in the initial tabulation, the number of continuing candidates is less than or equal to two (which is the number of offices to be filled for the New Jersey General Assembly in the legislative district), then all continuing candidates are elected and the tabulation is complete. If not, a series of tabulation rounds would proceed sequentially until candidates are elected by reaching the election threshold of 33 percent of the votes plus one. If the sum of the number of elected candidates and the number of continuing candidates is equal to three (the sum of one and the number of offices to be elected), then the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, all other continuing candidates are elected, and the tabulation is complete. However, if at least one continuing candidate has more votes than the election threshold, then each such candidate is elected, and each ballot counting for an elected candidate is assigned a ""transfer value"" so that the candidate's surplus votes (beyond the election threshold) are distributed to the next ranked continuing candidate on those ballots. If, after these steps, no candidate is elected, then the continuing candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, and a new round of counting begins until the positions are filled as the remaining candidates reach the election threshold. The bill directs the Secretary of State to issue guidelines and promulgate any rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the ranked-choice voting procedures established by the bill. The bill would take effect immediately, but would remain inoperative until the January 1st following 12 months after the Secretary of State officially certifies that all voting machines used in this State have the capability to support ranked-choice voting. However, the bill's provisions concerning elections to the office of Governor would be implemented if the voters approve an amendment to the State Constitution authorizing ranked-choice for that office.

The bill further provides that the electronic mail address of any voter who requests to receive a sample ballot by electronic mail would not be a government record under the ""Open Public Records Act,"" would not be available for public inspection or copying, and must be redacted from any document that it is a part of. The bill provides that the registered voter shall provide the voter's physical address on the request to receive the sample ballot and documents by electronic mail.

However, a first-time voter in this situation would be required to present only one document with respect to both identification requirements, if that document is able to satisfy the document criteria as applicable to each requirement. The requirement for verifying voter identity through additional documentation would not apply to any voter entitled to vote by mail-in ballot under the federal ""Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,"" or provided the right to vote otherwise than in person under the federal ""Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act,"" or any other federal law. Additionally, because the bill's verification of identity requires the production of a document containing a photograph of the voter, it incorporates an exemption from the production of such document if the voter has a religious objection to being photographed, and this is established by a sworn affidavit from the voter.

The bill places the question of whether a convention should be convened before the voters at a general election. The approval by the voters at that general election would confer upon the convention the authority to recommend relevant changes to the State Constitution and changes to the New Jersey statutes. The convention's recommendations for changes to the State Constitution and changes to the New Jersey statutes would be presented to the voters as a single package for their approval at the next general election; except that, if a temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes for voter approval is not placed on the ballot at a general election, the convention may anticipate that such a constitutional amendment may be placed on the next general election ballot at the same time as the convention's proposal and the convention, at its discretion, may structure its proposal so that, if the constitutional amendment fails to receive voter approval, the convention's entire proposal will also fail, or any constitutional amendments proposed by the convention and approved by the voters, but not statutory changes, will be adopted. Thus, statutory changes proposed by the convention will become effective if a separate temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes for voter approval is adopted not later than the general election at which the voters approve the convention's proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill also provides that at an annual school election, two delegates to the convention will be elected from each of the 40 legislative districts, for a total of 80 elected delegates. The names of candidates for the office of delegate on the ballot will rotate in successive election districts in order to limit any potential impact of ballot position on voter choice. A nominee for election of the office of delegate would not be bracketed with any other candidate on the ballot and no designation, slogan or affiliation for a nominee would be printed on the ballot. The bill limits the amount of a contribution to a candidate for the office of delegate from any contributor to $250 with a limit of $6,250 in the aggregate on contributions to all candidates for the office of delegate. Delegates would be nominated by a petition signed by at least 100 registered voters of the district from which the delegate seeks election. Local elected officials would be eligible to serve as delegates, but members of the Legislature would be ineligible to be elected, or to serve, as delegates. Labor organizations and corporations would be prohibited from contributing to the campaigns of candidates for the office of delegate. The bill establishes a voluntary limit of $25,000 on expenditures made in connection with a candidacy for the office of delegate. Any candidate, or any committee, group or organization in support of that candidate, that pledges to expend, and expends, less than that amount in connection with that candidate's candidacy may include on its campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate, committee, group, or organization has complied with the voluntary campaign expenditure limit. Any candidate for the office of delegate, or any committee, group or organization in support of that candidate, that expends more than $25,000 in connection with that candidate's candidacy would be required to include on all subsequent campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate, committee, group, or organization has exceeded the voluntary campaign expenditure limit.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the 80 elected delegates to the convention, 10 additional delegates will be appointed, two each by the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly, and the Minority Leader of the General Assembly. These appointments will be made within ten days of the certification of the results of the election for delegates. In making the appointments, the appointing authorities will take into consideration this State's demographic diversity and the degree to which that diversity is represented by the delegates elected to the convention. The duty of the convention will be to prepare a proposal consisting of amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and, if the voters approve a temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes, changes to existing law, which, while revenue neutral in their overall impact, eliminate inequities in the current system of property taxation, ensure greater uniformity in the application of property taxes, reduce property taxes as a share of overall public revenue, provide alternatives which lessen the dependence of local government on property taxes, or provide alternative means, including possible increases in other taxes, of funding local government services. The bill expressly provides that the convention may not propose amendments affecting the obligation of the Legislature, under the New Jersey Constitution, to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools or the obligation of any municipality to provide affordable housing pursuant to decisions of the New Jersey Supreme Court. In addition, the convention will not consider or recommend any proposal providing for a Statewide equalized school property tax, or detracting from collective bargaining rights or dispute resolution procedures as those rights and procedures exist on the effective date of this act, or that fails to provide tenants of residential rental units with their proportionate share of any property tax reduction, in a non-discriminatory manner, for as long as the reduction lasts.</p><p>&nbsp;Any changes of the New Jersey statutes recommended by the convention and approved by the voters at a general election held and will thereafter be subject to amendment or repeal by the Legislature and the Governor in the same manner as other laws. The convention is limited to considering the issue of tax reform. It may not consider any other issues. The bill directs the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court to appoint a committee of three retired members of the Judiciary, no more than two of whom shall be of the same political party, that will review proposals prepared by the convention during the course of the convention's proceedings and advise the convention whether such proposals are in compliance with the convention's instructions as voted by the people and do not exceed those instructions or the convention's limited purpose in any way. The convention will not take a vote on its final proposal to be placed on the ballot for voter approval unless the committee has certified that the convention has complied with its instructions and not exceeded those instructions or its limited purpose. The bill directs the Legislative Services Commission to undertake certain research tasks in advance of the convention, as well as during the convention, and to recruit qualified employees who may be employed by the convention.

Under the pilot program, the commissioner of registration, county clerk, and county board of elections in each county would collectively designate one or more locations in each county to allow for same-day voter registration for all eligible residents of that county who wish to register to vote. A voter who registers to vote under the same-day voter registration pilot program would be required to meet the voter eligibility criteria under current law and to complete a voter registration form. Upon registering to vote, such a voter would be directed to the voter's designated polling place and be permitted to cast a provisional ballot.

However, the bill would not prevent any purchase, lease, servicing, or use of any voting machine or voting system approved by the Secretary of State before its effective date for the duration of an existing contract or agreement with a vendor, and its provisions would apply prospectively upon the expiration of an existing contract or agreement.</p>"

The bill specifies that within five years all counties must (1) use paper ballots and optical scanners that read hand-marked paper ballots and (2) use voting equipment certified for use by the Secretary of State that has open-source software technology. As used in the bill, the term ""open-source"" means the complete source code for the software is available to the public, under the terms of a license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or other considerations. Under the bill, the paper ballot voting system must: (1) provide the local elections officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place; (2) provide a record of votes cast for the election; (3) adhere to any federal laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and (4) adhere to any other requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of a paper ballot voting system in this State. The bill directs the Secretary of State to require that each county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an election for a period of not less than two years following the date of an election. Thereafter, the ballots may be retained in accordance with procedures set forth by the Secretary of State. The bill also requires that prior to verification of the official election results by a county clerk or superintendent of elections or a municipal clerk, as the case may be, the county clerk or superintendent of elections or municipal clerk must: (1) compare and reconcile the record of votes casts provided by the optical scanners or other voting equipment certified by the State with the number of voters who signed in at the polling place and who voted by mail-in, provisional, and military or overseas ballots; (2) compare and reconcile precinct totals with the totals for that election to ensure that the totals add up to the correct sum; and (3) review, and account for, all optical scanner or other voting equipment memory cards or flash drives to ensure the memory cards or flash drives are properly loaded into the tally server. Under the bill, after a voter is deemed qualified to vote in an election, the voter would receive a paper ballot, which would be completed by the voter in a voting booth. Once completed, the ballot would be scanned electronically for technical errors, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted. If such an error exists, it would be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot would be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voter's vote from being counted. If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found, the ballot would be considered valid and would be counted. The bill also makes an appropriation and provides that the cost of replacing exiting direct recording electronic voting machines with paper ballots and the voting equipment necessary to tabulate those ballots would be paid for by the State upon application for reimbursement by a county governing body to the Secretary of State and approval of the application by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The bill also repeals various statutes concerning certain requirements and the certification of electronic voting machines and the purchasing and delivery of those voting machines. Under this bill, a limited number of voting machines would be available for use by individuals with disabilities.</p>"

The bill requires a voter, whether voting in person or through mail-in ballot, to show or submit a copy of a New Jersey's driver's license, New Jersey nondriver's identification card, or other document, that includes all of the following criteria: (1) the name of the voter to whom the document was issued; (2) a photograph of the voter to whom the document was issued; (3) an expiration date, showing that the document is not expired or expired only after the date of the most recent election; and (4) was issued by the federal government or this State. For first-time voters, this documentation is required in addition to the production of any document necessary to fulfill the proof of identity requirement mandated by the federal ""Help America Vote Act of 2002,"" if that first-time voter had registered to vote by mail without submitting federally-acceptable identity verification with the registration. However, a first-time voter in this situation is required to present only one document with respect to both identification requirements, if that document is able to satisfy the document criteria as applicable to each requirement. The requirement for verifying voter identity through additional documentation does not apply to any voter entitled to vote by mail-in ballot under the federal ""Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,"" or provided the right to vote otherwise than in person under the federal ""Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act,"" or any other federal law. Additionally, because the bill's verification of identity requires the production of a document containing a photograph of the voter, it incorporates an exemption from the production of such document if the voter has a religious objection to being photographed, and this is established by a sworn affidavit from the voter. In order to administer the bill's new voter verification requirement, the bill updates the statutory provisions governing election day challenges to a person's right to vote by district board members or other authorized challengers. With respect to any voter who is denied the right to vote for failing to display acceptable documentation, that voter is to be provided a provisional ballot. In order for that ballot to be officially counted in an election, the voter would need to produce the required documentation by the close of business on the second day after the election to the applicable county commissioner of registration. Finally, the Motor Vehicle Commission is required to issue a nondriver identification card without cost to any voter requiring such document upon execution of an affidavit of indigence.</p>"

The bill defines ""instant run-off voting"" to mean an election in which voters may rank up to five candidates in order of preference, first, second and so on, and in which tabulation proceeds in up to two rounds as follows: If the candidate with the most votes receives a vote total less than fifty percent plus one vote, the two candidates with the most votes proceed to a second round of ballot counting. In the second round, each ballot is counted as a vote for whichever of the two advancing candidates is ranked higher by that voter. Any ballot that does not rank either of the two advancing candidates would not be counted in the second round. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is then declared the winner. The bill requires the portion of the ballot pertaining to elections conducted by instant run-off voting allow a voter to rank candidates in order of choice in a way that is clear and easy to understand and include the opportunity to rank no more than one write-in candidate. The bill also requires ballots be designed so that a voter may mark their first choice in the same manner as for offices not elected by instant run-off voting.&nbsp;</p>"
